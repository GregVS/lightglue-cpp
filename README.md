# LightGlue C++

C++ binding for LightGlue. It is based on the [LightGlue Python package](https://github.com/cvg/LightGlue).

Note that this runs Python code. The library currently does not have a native C++ implementation. It's useful if you want to quickly integrate LightGlue in a C++ project.

You'll want to create a Python virtual environment and activate it before building.
